          <p>
            I hold a BSc (Bachelor of Science) in Psychology and an MSc (Master
            of Science) in Neuroscience and Neuropsychological Rehabilitation. I
            began my career supporting individuals with brain injuries and
            neurological conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following this, I completed a PGDip (Post Graduate Diploma) in CBT
            (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), and I became a fully accredited
            Cognitive Behavioural Therapist (MBABCP - Member of the British
            Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies),
            specialising in supporting people with common mental health
            difficulties.
          </p>
          <p>
            I now have over 10 years of experience working in mental health
            across both the private and public sectors, supporting adults with a
            wide range of difficulties, including anxiety, depression, and
            stress-related concerns. I offer evidence-based CBT in one-to-one
            online sessions for individuals aged 18 and over.
          </p>
          <p>
            While CBT is my primary therapeutic approach, I also draw from other
            modalities, such as ACT (Acceptance & Commitment Therapy), CFT
            (Compassion-Focused Therapy), and mindfulness-based approaches. This
            integrative style allows me to tailor treatment to your unique
            needs.
